### Overview

The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive guide for the development, deployment, and maintenance of a web application designed to collect and display data from disaster-affected areas. This application aims to facilitate real-time data collection and dissemination to assist in disaster management and response.

### Description

The system collects data from disaster-affected areas, uploads it to a central database, and displays it on a web page. The data collection occurs in areas with limited network access and is then transmitted to areas with network coverage for upload to the database.

### Components

- **Frontend**: Developed  React
- **Backend**: Developed using Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **API**: RESTful API for communication between frontend and backend.

### Data Flow

1. **Data Collection**: Data is collected using mobile devices and sensors.
2. **Data Transmission**: Collected data is transmitted to intermediate upload stations.
3. **Data Upload**: Data is uploaded from the upload stations to the central database.
4. **Data Storage**: Uploaded data is stored in the central database.
5. **Data Display**: Data is fetched from the database and displayed on the web application.

### Technical Specifications

### Software Requirements

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**:  MongoDB
- **APIs**: RESTful services

### User Interface

We used the Figma design to check with the interface and also for the UI and UX
